      <h2>sdpctl appliance upgrade prepare</h2><p>Prepare the appliances for upgrade</p><hr /><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Prepare an upgrade but do NOT install it.
This means the upgrade file will be downloaded/uploaded to all the appliances,
the signature verified as well as any other preconditions applicable at this point.</p><p>There are initial checks on the filename before attempting to upload it to the Appliances.
If a local upgrade image is uploaded to the Controller, the only pre-condition is that the filename ends with the file extension &lsquo;.img.zip&rsquo;.
If, however, the file is hosted on a server and a URL is provided to the prepare command, the filename should also contain a version, such as 6.0.3.
Otherwise the prepare will fail.</p><p>Note that the &lsquo;&ndash;image&rsquo; flag also accepts URL:s. The Appliances will then attempt to download
the upgrade image using the provided URL. It will fail if the Appliances cannot access the URL.</p><pre class="code-editor"><code>sdpctl appliance upgrade prepare [flags]
