the appliance you want to take a backup of.

The default destination directory is set to be the users default downloads directory on the system. If the default destination is used, an 'appgate' directory
will be created there if it doesn't already exist and the backups will be downloaded to that. In case custom destination directory is specified by using the
'--destination' flag, the extra 'appgate' directory will not be created. The user also has to have write privileges on the specified directory.
